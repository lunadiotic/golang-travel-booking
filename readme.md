## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture approach with the following directories:

- `cmd`: Contains the main entry points for the application.
  - `api`: The main web application that exposes the API endpoints.
  - `migration`: A command-line tool for running database migrations.
- `database`: Contains the SQL scripts for the database migrations.
- `internal`: Contains the core logic of the application.
  - `delivery`: Handles the HTTP request handling and routing.
  - `domain`: Defines the core entities and interfaces for the application.
  - `repository`: Implements the data access layer.
  - `usecase`: Implements the main business logic of the application.
- `pkg`: Contains utility packages, such as configuration, database connection, middleware, and logging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.16 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation
